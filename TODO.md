# JobService Development Roadmap

This document outlines the planned development steps for the JobService project, prioritized by importance and implementation complexity.

## üèÜ High Priority - Core Functionality

### 1. Comprehensive Testing
**Status**: Pending  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

- [ ] **Integration tests** for complete task lifecycle (create ‚Üí run ‚Üí cancel ‚Üí delete)
- [ ] **Concurrent operation tests** to verify SQLite fixes work under load
- [ ] **Error scenario testing** (database failures, task timeouts, network issues)
- [ ] **Performance tests** with multiple simultaneous jobs
- [ ] **Edge case testing** (rapid create/delete cycles, long-running tasks)

**Why**: Ensures reliability of the atomic delete implementation and task management system.

### 2. Job Status Monitoring
**Status**: Pending  
**Priority**: High  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days

- [ ] Add gRPC endpoint: `GetJobStatus(jobId)` - Real-time task status and progress
- [ ] Add gRPC endpoint: `ListActiveJobs()` - Currently running jobs with status
- [ ] Add gRPC endpoint: `GetJobHistory()` - Completed/failed job history with filters
- [ ] Extend proto definitions for status responses
- [ ] Add job status caching for performance

**Why**: Users need visibility into long-running operations and system state.

## üîß Medium Priority - Enhanced Features

### 3. Progress Tracking
**Status**: Pending  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days

- [ ] Extend `IJobTaskExecutor` interface to report progress percentages
- [ ] Add `ProgressPercent`, `CurrentStep`, `EstimatedCompletion` to Job model
- [ ] Implement progress reporting in `DefaultJobTaskExecutor`
- [ ] Add database migration for progress fields
- [ ] Stream progress updates via gRPC streaming endpoint

**Why**: Better user experience for long-running jobs with real-time feedback.

### 4. Job Scheduling & Queuing
**Status**: Pending  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks

- [ ] **Job priorities** (High/Medium/Low) with priority queue implementation
- [ ] **Max concurrent jobs** configuration and enforcement
- [ ] **Job dependencies** (Job B waits for Job A completion)
- [ ] **Scheduled execution** (run at specific time/cron expressions)
- [ ] **Job queuing** when max concurrency reached
- [ ] **Queue management** endpoints (pause/resume queue, reorder jobs)

**Why**: Production workloads need orchestration and resource management.

### 5. Robust Job Execution
**Status**: Pending  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 weeks

- [ ] **Configurable job types** (replace hardcoded 5-minute simulation)
- [ ] **Job parameters** (environment variables, input files, command-line args)
- [ ] **Output capture** (stdout/stderr logs, result files, artifacts)
- [ ] **Retry mechanisms** for failed jobs with exponential backoff
- [ ] **Timeout configuration** per job type
- [ ] **Resource isolation** (working directory per job)

**Why**: Real-world job execution requires flexibility and robustness.

## üìä Medium Priority - Operations

### 6. Metrics & Observability
**Status**: Pending  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days

- [ ] **OpenTelemetry integration** (traces, metrics, logs)
- [ ] **Health checks** for database connectivity and task manager
- [ ] **Performance counters** (jobs/second, success rate, average duration)
- [ ] **Structured logging** with correlation IDs across requests
- [ ] **Prometheus metrics** export for monitoring systems
- [ ] **Custom dashboards** for operational visibility

**Why**: Production monitoring, debugging, and performance optimization.

### 7. Configuration & Deployment
**Status**: Pending  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Estimated Effort**: 3-5 days

- [ ] **Docker containerization** with multi-stage builds for optimization
- [ ] **Kubernetes manifests** with health checks, resource limits, scaling
- [ ] **Configuration management** (appsettings per environment)
- [ ] **Database migrations** in CI/CD deployment pipeline
- [ ] **Helm charts** for easy Kubernetes deployment
- [ ] **Environment-specific configs** (dev/staging/prod)

**Why**: Cloud-native deployment readiness and DevOps automation.

## üîí Lower Priority - Production Readiness

### 8. Security & Authentication
**Status**: Pending  
**Priority**: Low  
**Estimated Effort**: 1 week

- [ ] **mTLS** for secure gRPC communication
- [ ] **API authentication** (JWT tokens, API keys, OAuth2)
- [ ] **Authorization** (role-based job access, tenant isolation)
- [ ] **Input validation** and sanitization for all endpoints
- [ ] **Audit logging** for security events
- [ ] **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse

**Why**: Enterprise security requirements and compliance.

### 9. Advanced Features
**Status**: Pending  
**Priority**: Low  
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 weeks

- [ ] **Job templates** for common workflows and reusability
- [ ] **Job chaining** and complex workflows (DAG execution)
- [ ] **Resource limits** (CPU, memory limits per job)
- [ ] **Multi-tenant isolation** (separate job spaces per tenant)
- [ ] **Job artifacts** (file uploads/downloads, result storage)
- [ ] **Webhook notifications** for job completion/failure

**Why**: Advanced enterprise use cases and workflow automation.

## üéØ Recommended Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
1. **Comprehensive Testing** - Validate current implementation
2. **Job Status Monitoring** - Essential operational visibility

### Phase 2: Core Features (Weeks 3-6)
3. **Progress Tracking** - User experience improvement
4. **Job Scheduling & Queuing** - Production workload management
5. **Robust Job Execution** - Real-world job requirements

### Phase 3: Operations (Weeks 7-9)
6. **Metrics & Observability** - Production monitoring
7. **Configuration & Deployment** - Cloud deployment readiness

### Phase 4: Enterprise (Weeks 10+)
8. **Security & Authentication** - Enterprise security
9. **Advanced Features** - Complex use cases

## üìù Notes

- **Current State**: Basic CRUD operations with atomic task management implemented
- **SQLite Database**: Consider migration to PostgreSQL for production scalability
- **Testing Strategy**: Focus on integration tests over unit tests for this service
- **Documentation**: Update README.md with API documentation as features are added

## ü§ù Contributing

When implementing these features:
1. Create feature branches for each major item
2. Write tests before implementation (TDD approach)
3. Update API documentation in proto files
4. Add logging and error handling
5. Consider backward compatibility for API changes
